# GitHub Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates a simple GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys a static website to GitHub Pages whenever changes are made to the index.html file.

## Features

- Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- Triggers only when index.html is modified
- Uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
